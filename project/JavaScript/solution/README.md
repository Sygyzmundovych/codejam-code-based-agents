# Investigator Crew - TypeScript Solution

A multi-agent investigation system built with **LangGraph** and **SAP Cloud SDK for AI** to solve an art theft case. This TypeScript implementation provides a sophisticated agent orchestration system that mirrors the functionality of the Python CrewAI solution.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The solution uses three specialized agents working in sequence:

1. **Insurance Appraiser Agent** 🎨
   - Uses the RPT-1 model to predict missing insurance values
   - Analyzes stolen artwork data and completes appraisals
   - Tool: `call_rpt1`

2. **Evidence Analyst Agent** 🔍
   - Searches through document repositories using the grounding service
   - Analyzes evidence for each suspect
   - Tool: `call_grounding_service`

3. **Lead Detective Agent** 🕵️
   - Synthesizes findings from both agents
   - Identifies the most likely culprit
   - Provides comprehensive case conclusion

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+ and npm
- SAP AI Core account with:
  - OAuth credentials (client ID and secret)
  - RPT-1 model deployment
  - Grounding service pipeline configured
- OpenAI API key or SAP AI Core foundation model access

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your actual values:

```env
# SAP AI Core Configuration
AICORE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AICORE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
AICORE_AUTH_URL=https://your-auth-url.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token
AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP=default

# RPT-1 Model Deployment
RPT1_DEPLOYMENT_URL=https://your-deployment-url/v2/inference/deployments/your-deployment-id

# Grounding Service
GROUNDING_PIPELINE_ID=your-pipeline-id

# LLM Configuration
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Run the Investigation

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using the compiled version:

```bash
npm start
```

### Expected Output

The system will:

1. Initialize the three agents
2. Run the appraiser agent to predict missing insurance values
3. Run the evidence analyst to search for suspect evidence
4. Run the lead detective to synthesize findings and identify the culprit
5. Output a comprehensive investigation report

## 🔧 Key Components

### LangGraph State Graph

The investigation workflow is implemented as a LangGraph state graph with sequential execution:

```
START → Appraiser → Evidence Analyst → Lead Detective → END
```

Each node in the graph:

- Receives the current state
- Executes its specialized task
- Updates the state with its findings
- Passes control to the next node

### State Management

The agent state includes:

- `payload`: Stolen items data with prediction placeholders
- `suspect_names`: List of suspects to investigate
- `appraisal_result`: Output from the appraiser agent
- `evidence_analysis`: Output from the evidence analyst
- `final_conclusion`: Final report from the lead detective
- `messages`: Conversation history

### Tools

1. **call_rpt1**: Calls the RPT-1 model deployment via SAP AI Core
2. **call_grounding_service**: Queries the document grounding service for evidence

## 🔄 Comparing with Python Solution

This TypeScript solution provides equivalent functionality to the Python CrewAI implementation:

| Feature             | Python (CrewAI)                       | TypeScript (LangGraph)        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Framework           | CrewAI                                | LangGraph                     |
| Agent Orchestration | `@agent`, `@task`, `@crew` decorators | StateGraph with nodes         |
| Configuration       | YAML files                            | Direct code configuration     |
| Tool Definition     | `@tool` decorator                     | `tool()` from @langchain/core |
| Process Flow        | `Process.sequential`                  | Graph edges (START → END)     |
| State Management    | Automatic by CrewAI                   | Explicit state updates        |
| AI SDK              | `gen_ai_hub` (Python)                 | `@sap-ai-sdk` (TypeScript)    |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

If you see OAuth token errors:

- Verify your `AICORE_CLIENT_ID` and `AICORE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Check that `AICORE_AUTH_URL` is correct
- Ensure your credentials have the necessary permissions

### RPT-1 Deployment Errors

If the RPT-1 call fails:

- Verify the `RPT1_DEPLOYMENT_URL` is correct
- Check that the deployment is running in SAP AI Core
- Ensure the `AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP` matches your deployment

### Grounding Service Errors

If evidence search fails:

- Verify the `GROUNDING_PIPELINE_ID` is correct
- Ensure the grounding pipeline is deployed and running
- Check that documents are uploaded to the vector database
